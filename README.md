# Cybersecurity_Bootcamp_Project
The document comprises of capstone projects focused on cybersecurity: Incident Response Playbooks, building a secure small network, applying cryptography in real-world scenarios, and demonstrating the security differences between FTP and SFTP.

## TASK 1: Developing Incident Response Playbooks
### Scope:
Students will develop playbooks for at least three common incident types, such as phishing attacks, ransomware infections, insider threats, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Each playbook will outline clear steps for detection, containment, eradication, and recovery, while also defining roles, communication plans, and metrics for success.

Requirement:Develop IR playbooks for at least 3 incident scenarios (e.g., phishing, ransomware, DDoS).
Each playbook should cover: 
- Incident Identification: Triggers and indicators.
- Incident Response Phases: Detection, containment, eradication, recovery.
- Roles and Responsibilities: Who handles each part of the response (incident commander, technical lead, etc.).
- Communication Strategy: How and when to communicate with internal teams and external stakeholders (e.g., media, regulators).
- Metrics: Criteria for measuring the success of the response (e.g., time to resolve, systems affected).

## TASK 2: Building a Secure Small Network
### Scope: 
Students will simulate a small office or personal network setup. They'll design how devices connect, apply basic security rules (like firewalls and segmentation), and test the setup using tools such as Nmap (for scanning) and Wireshark (for traffic analysis). The emphasis is on practical understanding and being able to explain what was done and why.

## TASK 3: Applying Cryptography in Real-World Scenarios
### Scope:
Students will use cryptographic tools (like OpenSSL, GPG, or built-in OS commands) to encrypt files, verify integrity, and simulate secure messaging or storage. The project emphasizes the real-world applications of cryptography, focusing on data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

## TASK 4: Demonstrating FTP vs. SFTP Security
### Scope:
Students will set up basic FTP and SFTP sessions to transfer files between a client and server (can be virtual machines or local tools). They will use a packet capture tool (like Wireshark) to analyze the data transmitted during these transfers, showing the difference in security.
